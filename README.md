# AutoHome 

This small application was something that I used when my girlfriend and I were looking for a house to buy. It basically:
- scraps 5 real-estate agencies in the North-West part of France
- gathers the results in a single dataframe
- displays and sorts the results on a Streamlit web application

It mainly relies on:
- BeautifulSoup
- Streamlit

To run it, simply use:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And launch the app via:

```
streamlit run app.py
```
